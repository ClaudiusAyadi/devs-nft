# DEVSNFT MINTING DApp

_Hi! You are welcome again!_

This is my 3rd DApp following the [learnweb3DAO tracks](https://learnweb3.io). It is the final part of our NFT collection DApp.

I built it with `Solidity`, `React`, and `Next.js`.

**HOW IT WORKS**

1. Users should get whitelisted using the NFT Whitelisting DApp I created previously. [See it here][https://whitelist-dapp.claudiusayadi.vercel.app/].

2. Then, come back here and click on the live demo link at the bottom here ðŸ‘‡

3. Connect your wallet, it is automatic if you are on Rinkeby network. Just approve and get connected.

4. If the presale has started and your address is whitelisted, you would be able to mint a DevsNFT. You should get an error message if either of the conditions wasn't meant.

5. If you did not get into the whitelist, wait for Public Round to mint.

6. Two other possibilities are: the minting interval has ended for both presale and public rounds, or we have exceeded the maximum limit of NFTs to be minted.

You can see the implementation of the above logic in the smart contract, and the possible interactions and queries from the frontend directory.

_As always, I do welcome improvements, suggestions, and even critics. Thank you!_
